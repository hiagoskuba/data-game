## About
This project is a micro-learning tool designed to sharpen the intuition of data professionals. It challenges users with real-world scenarios regarding sampling, variable types, and the logic behind informed decision-making.

## The Process
Built as a **"vibe coding" experiment**, this quiz leverages **Stlite (Streamlit + WebAssembly)** to run Python logic directly in the browser. The focus was on translating complex statistical concepts from my personal study notes into a gamified experience that feels like Google Word Coach.

## Key Learning Tracks
The quiz covers essential pillars of BI and Data Science, directly inspired by my research on data reliability:
* **Sampling Methods:** Distinguishing between probabilistic and non-probabilistic approaches.
* **Variable Classification:** Understanding the hierarchy of data (Qualitative vs. Quantitative).
* **Causality & Logic:** Identifying dependent variables in business environments.



## Tech Stack & Architecture
* **Logic:** Python (Streamlit)
* **Runtime:** Stlite (WebAssembly) for serverless deployment.
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages.
* **Safety:** Designed with a "Server-side first" mindset, ensuring data integrity and professional architectural standards.

## Goal
The ultimate goal is to achieve the **"Trustworthy Analyst"** badge by maintaining a high confidence score throughout the challenges, proving that the user can mitigate biases in data collection.

## Feedback
As this is an iterative project, I'm always looking to refine the question sets and the UI/UX.

* **Feel free to share your feedback or open an issue.**
* **Your perspectives on data ethics and BI logic are always welcome.**
